There has been a recent increase in high quality and large sample studies of the neonatal and infant brain
(exemplified in studies such as the developing and baby Human Connectome Projects). The brain develops
extremely rapidly over the perinatal period and much more than any other time in postnatal life.
This presents challenges in image processing (both shape and intensity is changing) and image statistics. Standard
neuroimaging pipelines, tailored for child or adult populations, do not work. Developmental trajectories are highly
non-linear so typical statistical approaches are imprecise or in many cases inappropriate.

The combination of these difficulties mean that analysis pipelines for the developing brain are highly innovative.
This challenge proposal will seek to draw and develop pipelines built at sites internationally into one place while
addressing 3 crucial questions in the field: 

1. Can we detect lesions or abnormalities in a way that is robust to the age of a neonate at time of scan. 
2. Can we estimate the age at birth of preterm neonates scanned at later age. 
3. Can we use classification tools to encapsulate qualitative clinical radiological scores of brain injury.
